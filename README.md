Yet Another Reddit Reader!

But this time, the posts and comments slide through your screen, flipboard-style.

This project is not on the Play Store, as it is unfinished.

Todo
----
* Reddituser-interaction
* Sidebar
* Add more page types (add youtube api)
* Use a Cards Library (for titles of pages, comments, album images, ...)
* Work around recursive Viewpager limit in comment section
* Details (Connection checking, Loading animations, Intents, SideBar)

Screenshots
-----------
* An Imgur "Page" and An article page;

Pictures in an album are view-paged vertically.

Pages not in a Set of known domains are run through readability and re-paged to fit in a vertical viewpager.

The orangered and periwinkle lines denote from where the user should drag to up-/ downvote.

* Comments Section of a page;

The dots give more info about the comments, and slide with the comment to the side (Sibling comments are horizontally 'swipable');
